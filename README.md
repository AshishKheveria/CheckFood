# CheckFood
This app will tell you if the capture or uploaded image is a hotdog or not by using Machine Learning.

## Our Goal

One of the most fundamental component of modern iOS apps is the Table View. Table Views are used everywhere from the Mail app to the Messages app. It’s a crucial part of every iOS developer’s tool belt. In this tutorial we’ll be getting to grips with Table Views, creating custom cells, and making our own cloud-based backend database. It’s going to be epic, so buckle up.

## What you will create

CheckFood is an app that uses *Inceptionv3* machine learning model to recognise the food or in our app's case whther its a "hotdog" or "not a hotdog". 

## ML Model Used

*Inceptionv3*
